Edfa3ly shopping cart is a way to submit an order, by adding product's URL which has been gotten from any store like Amazon, eBay, etcâ€¦ to the cart then check out the cart.

This scenario contains repeated steps to test the fucntionality of **Edfa3ly Shopping Cart**.

So, I wrote an automated testcases using **Selenium Webdriver using Java Programming Language**.
