# Overview

Edfa3ly shopping cart is a way to submit an order, by adding product's URL which has been gotten from any store like Amazon, eBay, etcâ€¦ to the cart then check out the cart.

***There are 3 different types of URL covered in Edfa3ly Shopping Cart.***
1. Automated Products Links.
2. Non-Automated Products Links.
3. Prohibted Products Links.


This scenario contains repeated steps to test the fucntionality of **Edfa3ly Shopping Cart**.

So, I wrote an automated testcases which covers **Automated and Prohibted Product Links** using **Selenium Webdriver using Java Programming Language**.

# Why Automated Tests?

Automated tests can be written once and then run many times, for example every day, or, every time we change our code.

Refactoring, optimising and parallelising code without automated tests can be done, but it is like climbing without a rope, only for the brave and skilled!
